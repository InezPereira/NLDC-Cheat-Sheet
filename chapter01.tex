\subsection{Dynamical systems}
\textbf{Dynamical system}: any system where time plays a role.
\textbf{Non-autonomous equations}: time-dependent.)
\begin{tcolorbox}
    \textbf{Phase space P} 
    \begin{quote}
        \textbf{The phase space is completely filled with trajectories}, since each point can serve as an initial condition. (Strogatz)
    \end{quote}
    \textbf{Space of evolutionary variable E}: For us, it will always be time.\\
    \textbf{Evolution rule $F$}: Defines transition from one state to the next. In this course, we only consider deterministic $F$, meaning you have existence and uniqueness.
\end{tcolorbox}
    

\subsection{Types of evolutionary rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discrete dynamical systems (DDS)}: iterated maps
    \item \textbf{Continuous dynamical systems (CDS)}: 1st order systems of ODEs, with initial value problem. With this, you define the  \textbf{flow map}, which has \textbf{important group properties}! \danger
\end{itemize}
